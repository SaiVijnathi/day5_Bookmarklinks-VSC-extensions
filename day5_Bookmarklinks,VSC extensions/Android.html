    <h2 id="s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</h2>
    <img src="./Images/s24.jpg" width="250px" />
    <p>
      Samsung's new Galaxy S24 line is the first to go all-in on AI, and the S24
      Ultra, the most premium of the three, is the best Android phone today. The
      new Galaxy AI model embedded in the device brings a host of generative
      capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, the ability to
      circle an object on screen to perform an image-based Google search,
      AI-assisted photo editing and transcriptions, and even a Chat Assist
      feature for figuring out how to phrase a message in different tones. Like
      its predecessor, the S23 Ultra, the S24 Ultra is built with a large
      6.8-inch AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. Though the price
      has gone up to $1,299 ($100 more than the S23 Ultra), the phone's upgrades
      make it well worth it: The S24 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable
      titanium frame, compared to last year's aluminum, and features Corning's
      latest Gorilla Armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood, the S24 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Gen 3
      chipset for improved graphics and AI features, 12GB RAM (an increase from
      last year's 8GB), and 2,600 nits of brightness -- a big improvement over
      last year's 1,750. As for the new camera system, the big upgrade comes in
      the form of a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. As Hiner
      discovered, the results were sharper and less noisy images and an overall
      camera system that could pull in more light than ever before.

    <h2 id="8a">Google Pixel 8a</h2>
    <img src="./Images/8a.jpg" width="250px" />
    <p>
      If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Google Pixel 8a.
      There are three key reasons why you should buy the latest Pixel over any
      other mid-range phone: For $499, you get a comfortable 6.1-inch OLED
      display that ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, a reliable 64MP camera
      system, and Google's catalog of AI features like Magic Editor, Audio
      Eraser, and Gemini, all backed by seven years of operating system updates.
      Software is the name of the game with Google Pixel phones, and the
      extensive support provided for the 8a series, powered by a new Tensor G3
      chip, should keep it feature-relevant for as long as until 2031. For
      reference, most phones in this price range, including last year's Pixel
      7a, typically receive two to four years of software and security updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range,
      such as the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens and a slower wired charging
      rate (18W). However, from my hands-on time with the Pixel 8a, I found it
      just as capable of capturing various subjects and styles, and the presence
      of wireless charging makes up for the phone taking a few minutes longer to
      fully charge than flagship handsets. A significant drawback of the 8a is
      its charging speed, which, at only 18W, is slower than competing devices,
      several Reddit users have mentioned.

    <h2 id="one">OnePlus Open</h2>
    <img src="./Images/one.jpg" width="250px" />
    <p>
      The number of foldable phones on the market has never been higher, thanks
      to the collective effort of every manufacturer, including Google with its
      Pixel Fold, Motorola with its Razr lineup, and OnePlus with the OnePlus
      Open. While Samsung has held the reins of the best foldable honor for
      years, and the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold remains to be tested, I'm giving the
      top spot to the OnePlus Open right now. Unlike its competitors, the
      OnePlus Open strikes the best balance of weight-to-size ratio. When
      folded, the phone is as light as an iPhone, and when unfolded, it expands
      into a thin slate of visual goodness. OnePlus leverages the 7.8-inch
      display by offering some of the most intuitive multitasking features I've
      tested, headlined by "Open Canvas." With it, you can open up to three apps
      at once, and as you tap into each one, the other one or two will tuck
      itself to the side, ready to reappear when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      OnePlus got the fundamentals down pat with the Open, too, including 65W
      fast charging capabilities (with a charger in the box) that blow past
      Samsung's Z Fold 5 and Google's Pixel Fold standards, a base configuration
      of 16GB RAM and 512GB storage, and a crease-less inner display. The cherry
      on top for me is its $1,699 price tag. One Amazon customer even says the
      Open was a surprisingly smooth entryway into Android "after going with
      just iPhones since the iPhone 7."

    <p>
      When it comes to camera performance, you can't go wrong with any of the
      flagship devices from the big three (Apple, Samsung, and Google).
      Depending on your preference for color temperature and feature set, you
      may lean towards one manufacturer over the other. But more often than not,
      Google's Pixel camera system satisfies most users, and the latest Pixel 9
      Pro (and Pro XL) remains a champion for instant capturing and
      post-processing. Both sizes of the latest model feature a reliable triple
      lens setup, with a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP 5x
      telephoto lens for far-distance shots. They're backed by numerous software
      features like Google's Super Res Zoom (for up to 30x zoom photos), 8K
      video upscaling, and a new Add Me feature that lets you snap and merge two
      photos so everyone can be in the same shot. There's also a new 42MP selfie
      camera that's sharper and captures a wider FOV than last year's 10.8MP
      sensor. That should play well with group selfies and scenic shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile
      photography; there's also post-processing and the flexibility of devices
      with editing and tweaking subjects. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro,
      powered by a new Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and
      creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor,
      Photo Unblur, and Best Take that can turn any bad photo into a good one.

    <h2 id="z">Samsung Z Flip 6</h2>
    <img src="./Images/z.jpg" width="250px" />
    <p>
      The new Galaxy Z Flip 6, unveiled at Samsung Unpacked in July, packs a ton
      of character and features into a tiny clamshell that pays homage to flip
      phones of the past. Shape-shifting displays aside, the Z Flip 6 is very
      similar to the standard Samsung Galaxy S-series flagship, with a large
      6.7-inch AMOLED panel that's crisp and bright, up to 512GB of RAM for
      those high-resolution pictures and videos, and a healthy 4,000mAh battery
      powering it all -- an upgrade from the Z Flip 5. There's also now a
      Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and the first vapor cooling chamber
      ever on a Z Flip device, both of which should make the phone run more
      efficiently, reducing battery drainage. The phone is thinner and lighter
      than previous models, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Z Flip 6's camera system gets a nice boost, too, with an improved 50MP
      main sensor and 12MP ultra-wide. You'll also find a new AI-powered Auto
      Zoom feature, which automatically detects how many people are in a frame
      and potential background objects the user may want to keep in the shot and
      repositions them digitally.
