    <p>

      options.

    <p>
      With the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a
      discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699.
      And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming
      weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more
      convenient charging and an upgraded camera with a higher resolution and a
      crisper zoom, the iPhone 15 is a significant upgrade for those with older
      iPhones. It feels like a scaled back version of the iPhone 14 Pro, making
      Apple's entry-level iPhone 15 feel like a bigger leap forward than last
      year's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and
      the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro,
      the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those
      with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's
      second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes
      it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd. Last year's iPhone
      14 Pro may be a better choice if you can still find it through third-party
      retailers at a discount, particularly because it has a dedicated telephoto
      lens. But the iPhone 15 is the most exciting upgrade Apple's standard
      iPhone has seen in years. Read our iPhone 15 and 15 Plus review.

    <p>
      Apple announced the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max which go on sale Friday
      Sept. 20. The iPhone 15 Pro has been discontinued, though you can still
      buy it at some third-party retailers as they work through their existing
      stock. All that to say, only buy this phone at a discount. Apple gave its
      Pro models a glow-up with a refreshed lighter build, a new shortcut button
      and the world's smallest processor. And it did all this while managing to
      keep that tried-and-true iPhone aesthetic front and center. They also made
      more of a differentiation between the Pro and Pro Max model. The 15 Pro
      also still has the same familiar 3x telephoto camera found on previous
      models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brain behind the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is the A17 Pro chip, which
      has the performance chops to handle console tier video games like Resident
      Evil Village. If the A17 Pro chip is the brains, then iOS 17 is the 15 Pro
      and Pro Max's soul. The new OS is filled with lots of quality of life
      improvements throughout like StandBy mode, Check-In, Stickers in Messages
      and better autocorrect for the keyboard. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max
      are some of the best phones released by Apple or any phone maker this
      year.

    <p>
      Apple's 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max got the same glow-up treatment as the
      smaller iPhone 15 Pro, complete with a lighter titanium build and a new
      shortcuts button. But the Pro Max's 5x telephoto, compared to the regular
      Pro's 3x zoom, makes it the best iPhone for photographers. That extra zoom
      length gives you more reach to frame subjects that are farther away and
      should be great for filming kids playing sports or performing in a school
      concert. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is also rated for longer battery life than
      the 15 Pro, which could be useful for those who record a lot of video on
      their iPhone.

    <h2 id="Plus">iphone 15 Plus</h2>
    <img src="./Images/plus.jpg" width="250px" />
    <p>
      With the launch of the iPhone 16, the iPhone 15 Plus is being sold at a
      discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 Plus now starts at
      $799. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the
      coming weeks and months. If you want a big screen without splurging on the
      Pro Max, the iPhone 15 Plus is the way to go. It has all the same perks as
      the iPhone 15 -- such as USB-C charging, the Dynamic Island and a
      48-megapixel camera -- but inside a larger body with a 6.7-inch screen.
      The iPhone 15 Plus should also get longer battery life than the iPhone 15,
      according to Apple's claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple still sells the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus, but the iPhone 15 Plus'
      benefits are worth the extra $100. The changes mentioned above, along with
      the iPhone 15 Plus' newer chip and fresh design, will make it feel like a
      worthwhile upgrade, particularly for those coming from older phones.

    <h2 id="13">iphone 13</h2>
    <img src="./Images/13.webp" width="250px" />
    <p>
      The iPhone 13 is still an excellent phone. If you're considering buying an
      older iPhone to save money, the iPhone 13 is the best choice for most
      people. It has a lot in common with the iPhone 14, considering both phones
      run on the same A15 Bionic processor and have a 12-megapixel camera
      system. The iPhone 14's processor has an extra GPU core, but those who
      primarily use their phone for casual gaming, social media, checking email
      and watching video likely won't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the iPhone 13's best feature is its larger battery that, in our tests,
      lasted 4.5 hours more on a single charge than the iPhone 12, and nearly 3
      hours longer than the new iPhone 14. The 13 also has Cinematic mode, which
      is basically a video version of Portrait mode, and iOS 17. The iPhone 13
      earned a 2021 CNET Editors' Choice Award. Just remember the iPhone 13
      lacks satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services without a
      cell service and car crash detection, both of which are available on the
      iPhone 14 and 15 series. Such features may be important to consider if
      you're purchasing a phone for your child.
